Welcome to the most epic of websites.

To start hacking away, follow [Hacking](#hacking).

## Hacking

To get the dependencies of the project, run `npm install`.
To then get the dev server up, run `npm run dev`.
Then just connect your browser to [localhost:55173](http://localhost:55173).
Changes to the code will hot reload, so no need to restart it after small or large changes.

## Publishing

To create a release version, run `npm run build`.
You can then preview the results with `npm run preview` on [localhost:44173](http://localhost:44173).
